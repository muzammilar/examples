# Kafka - Single Broker Example

This example has been taken from [wurstmeister/kafka-docker](https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker).

## Testing

To test the Zookeeper/Kafka behaviour, do the following:

```bash
# run the containers
docker-compose up --detach

# ssh to the server (or any of other servers)
docker exec -it <server-name> bash

```
